# Base GAE project with Django Rest Framework

This is a base Google App Engine project that includes Django Rest Framework.

In order to use it clone the project, create virtual environment, and run <code>configure_requirements.py</code> script. This assumes that you have GAE installed and configured correctly. Running <code>which appcfg.py</code> in a terminal should respond with a full path to Appengine's <code>appcfg.py</code> script.
